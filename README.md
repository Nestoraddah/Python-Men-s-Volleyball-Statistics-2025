# NAIA Men’s Volleyball Performance Analytics (2025)
The project conducted an in-depth statistical analysis of 2025 NAIA Men’s Volleyball performance data to uncover competitive trends across players and conferences. Using Python (Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn, Matplotlib), the dataset was cleaned, standardized, and segmented to ensure accurate comparison of offensive and defensive metrics. The analysis evaluated key performance indicators such as points per set, hitting percentage, kill efficiency, digs per set, blocks per set, and service performance, enabling a holistic view of player contributions.

Business Questions Answered:

- Which players demonstrated the strongest overall impact based on scoring efficiency and consistency?

- How do conferences differ in offensive and defensive strengths, such as hitting efficiency and dig/block rates?

- Which performance variables most strongly correlate with match outcomes (e.g., high hitting percentage vs. total points)?

- How can teams leverage data to optimize rotations, identify undervalued athletes, and refine scouting processes?

Impact of the Analysis:
The findings revealed measurable differences among conferences—some excelling in high hitting percentages, while others showed stronger back-row defensive metrics. Identifying top performers across positions provides coaches with evidence-based insights for recruitment, lineup decisions, and targeted skill development. The study also highlights how analytics can support competitive benchmarking and strategic game planning.

Recommendations:

- Implement real-time performance dashboards for match-day decision-making.

- Use predictive modeling to estimate player development and match outcomes.

- Prioritize recruitment from conferences demonstrating high defensive efficiency.

- Conduct quarterly data reviews to align training with evolving performance trends.
